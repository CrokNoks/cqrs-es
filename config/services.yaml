# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed

parameters:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts:
    - elasticsearch:9200 # use for docker enviroment

services:
  # default configuration for services in *this* file
  _defaults:
    autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
    autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
    public: false       # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
      # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
    # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.

  # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
  # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
